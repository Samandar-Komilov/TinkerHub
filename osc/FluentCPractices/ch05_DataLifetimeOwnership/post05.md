# Chapter 5: Data Lifetime and Ownership

This chapter discusses patterns for how to structure your C program with object-like elements. For these object-like elements, the patterns put special focus on who is responsible for creating and destroying themâ€”in other words, they put special focus on lifetime and ownership. This topic is especially important for C because C has no automatic destructor and no garbage collection mechanism, and thus special attention has to be paid to cleanup of resources.

The following patterns are covered:
- **Stateless Software Module:** 
- **Software-Module With Global State:** 
- **Caller-Owned Instance:** 
- **Shared Instance:**
