# TinkerHub

Welcome to **TinkerHub**, a playground for coding experiments, feature exploration, and learning across multiple programming languages. This repository centralizes small projects and ideas, serving as a creative space to test new concepts, try out unfamiliar tools, and hone my skills in a variety of languages.

## Purpose

TinkerHub is designed to:
- **Experiment**: Test new features, libraries, or paradigms in a low-stakes environment.
- **Learn**: Explore different programming languages and frameworks through hands-on projects.
- **Organize**: Consolidate small projects from Python, Rust, Go, OS and C language combined, and more into a single, navigable repository.
- **Showcase**: Share my coding journey and creative experiments with the community.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into language-specific folders, with an additional space for cross-language or experimental projects:

```
TinkerHub/
â”œâ”€â”€ python/               # Python-based projects
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ project1/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ README.md
â”œâ”€â”€ rust/                 # Rust-based projects
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ project1/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ README.md
â”œâ”€â”€ go/                   # Go-based projects
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ project1/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ README.md
â”œâ”€â”€ osc/                  # OSC (OS + Clang) projects
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ project1/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ README.md
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md
â””â”€â”€ .gitignore
```

Each language folder contains individual projects with their own `README.md` files explaining their purpose, setup, and learnings.

## How to Navigate

- Browse the language folders (`python/`, `rust/`, etc.) to explore projects in specific languages.
- Read the `README.md` in each project folder for details on what it does and why it was created.
- Feel free to open issues or suggest ideas via the repository's issue tracker!
